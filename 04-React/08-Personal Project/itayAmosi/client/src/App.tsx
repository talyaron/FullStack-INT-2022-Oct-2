        Hello and welcome to my portfolio site! Here you can see the various
        projects I have worked on recently, both individually and in a team.
        Through these projects, I gained experience building and programming in
        languages such as HTML, SCSS, TypeScript and REACT. Additionally, I
        learned how to use MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. Thank you for
        visiting my site and I hope you enjoy browsing my work. I have prepared
        for you a selection of projects that you can watch and in addition you
        can comment your personal opinion!
